This is a takehome challenge for Mod 4 at Turing School of Software & Design. The rubric can be viewed [here.](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_rubric)

NY Times Reader is an application to allow users to view data from the New York Times Top Stories API. The user can filter search results by all major sections listed on the API as well as a 'home' view which shows articles currently on the homepage. 

The main page of the application shows a newsfeed, which is filtered by simple radio buttons in the menu bar. 
Each individual article can be selected to take the user to a full page view, which shows a photo from the article, the byline (author), when the article was published, an abstract, and a link to read the full article on the NY Times website.
